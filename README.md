## Overview & Feature

This tiny microservice returns the client's request header information as JSON, including the Host header (or the client's IP address), Accept-Language, and User-Agent.
- Host header: The domain name and port of the server the client wants to
- Accept-Language: A list of the natural languages and locales that the client prefers for the response (e.g., Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9,vi;q=0.8)
- User-Agent: A string that identifies the application, operation system, vendor, and/or version of the  requesting user agent (e.g., a browser like Chrome)
